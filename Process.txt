The steps of the encryption should look something like this regardless of programming language

Step 1: User input
    Codeword
    Message
    Omitted letter (optional)

Step 2: Formatting
    Message must be an even number of letters
    Message & codeword must not contain omitted letter
    Message & codeword should be lowercase

Step 3: Indexing
    Create index = codeword followed by 25 letter alphabet
    Remove all duplicate letters from index

    Must be able to track each letter in the message with its position in message and location in index
    Ex: juiceabdfghklmnopqrstvwxy attack at dawn
        a:0,5 t:1,20 t:2,20 a:3,5 c:4,3 etc.

Step 4: encryption
    characters at even positions
        index location goes through even formula
        new character assigned to new index location
    characters at odd positions
        index location goes through odd formula
        new character assigned to new index location
