# Playfair-Cipher
Some code to use the playfair cipher. I'm using a formula I created rather than developing a matrix or anything. So it's cool math time.

The playfair cipher is a graphical cipher that uses a 5x5 grid to rearrange pairs of letters. I created a formula that can represent the shift. I have attached a paper I wrote for my highschool math class that explains in detail the playfair cipher, my formula, as well as one or two other ciphers. There are lots of inaccuracies especially when I talk about RSA encryption. We'll just ignore those...

The java file works quite well. The one thing I would like to add is a feature that can remove repeated letters from the codeword, so "attack" would become "atck".
I have not found any bugs with it so far, but if anyone finds any inconsistencies with the original cipher I'd love to hear.
I have included the java source code as well as the class.

I am still working on the python file; it needs some serious work. I'm bad at python... For now...
